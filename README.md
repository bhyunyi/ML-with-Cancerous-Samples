# Transcriptomics Final

This is the final project for the Transcriptomics Class in Summer 2025 at NYU Tandon school of Engineering.

The project requirements are as follows: *For the final project, students are required to read the primary literature, identify a biological problem and the available datasets to work with (these data may be your own), and undertake a computational analysis to tackle the problem. The Transcriptome project must have atleast two factors. If there is only factor, there must be several levels.
For their final report, students will generate written report of their study (a document with the report and another with all the relevant code) and present their projects to instructors and fellow students.*

Our research question: *Can we use expression profiles of known human transcription factors to distinguish between healthy and diseased samples?*
