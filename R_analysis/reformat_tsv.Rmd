## Reformatting code

The code below will be used to reformat the tsv files from the nf_core pipeline. 
Pathways may need to be edited for personal use. 
- the two tsv files are downloaded onto my personal computer and are not in the GitHub!

```{r readin}
# First lets read in the two files. 
library(readr)
file1 <- read_tsv("C:/Users/tiffa/OneDrive/Desktop/Masters in Bioinformatics/Transcriptomics/Final/salmon.merged.transcript_tpm_1_60.tsv")

file2 <- read_tsv("C:/Users/tiffa/OneDrive/Desktop/Masters in Bioinformatics/Transcriptomics/Final/salmon.merged.transcript_tpm_61_98.tsv")

# just to look
head(file1)
head(file2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
