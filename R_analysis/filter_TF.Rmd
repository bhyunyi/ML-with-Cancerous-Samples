## Transcription Factor filtering code

the columns of the data frame needed to be filtered based on a list of known transcription factors
so the column names could of had a go term analysis done on it to get a list of transcripts that are transcription factors
then you use that list to filter the master tsv files
just reducing the number of columns to only include transcription factors
